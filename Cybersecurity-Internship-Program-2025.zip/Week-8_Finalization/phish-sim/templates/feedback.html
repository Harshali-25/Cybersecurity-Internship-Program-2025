  {% if result == "report" %}
    <p><strong>Nice — you reported it.</strong> That’s the correct action for suspicious messages. Key signs: urgent language, unexpected attachments/links, mismatched sender.</p>
  {% elif result == "click" %}
    <p><strong>You clicked/opened the link.</strong> In real life this is risky. Common red flags you may have missed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unexpected sender or unknown domain</li>
      <li>Urgency or threats (like "act now")</li>
      <li>Link mismatch (hover to see real URL)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember: never enter credentials on an unknown site. This is a simulation — no data was collected.</p>
  {% else %}
    <p>You ignored it. That’s safe if you were unsure, but best practice is to <strong>report</strong> suspicious messages to security so they can investigate.</p>
